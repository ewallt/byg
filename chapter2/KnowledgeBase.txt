 CHAPTER SUMMARY DOCUMENT

BOOK: Behold Your God  CHAPTER NUMBER: 2  CHAPTER TITLE: This is Eternal Life  PAGE RANGE: pp. 7–15

I. THE POINT OF THE CHAPTER (Central Thesis/Message):
The author’s central argument is that a true, experiential knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ is eternal life itself; this knowledge alone transforms character, imparts divine power and peace, and secures salvation, while ignorance or distortion of God’s character leads inevitably to spiritual ruin and eternal death.

II. HOW THE AUTHOR MAKES HIS CASE (Argumentation & Evidence):
A. Initial Premise / Opening Assertion(s):
The chapter opens by treating John 17:3 as an exact equation: life eternal = knowledge of God and Christ, and the absence of that knowledge = death eternal.

Foundational Assertion(s) Addressed: The indispensable identification of eternal life with knowing God.
Author’s Explanation/Elaboration: The Amplified Bible clarifies the depth of “know”—to perceive, recognize, and understand.
Key Authorial Statement: “Life eternal is the knowledge of God and Jesus Christ, and a lack of the knowledge of God and Jesus Christ is death eternal.”

Supporting Scripture:

Reference: John 17:3 [Amplified Bible]
Author's Use/Interpretation: Establishes the life-knowledge equation.
Quoted Text: “And this is eternal life: [it means] to know (to perceive, recognize, become acquainted with and understand) You, the only true and real God, and [likewise] to know Him, Jesus [as the] Christ, the Anointed One, the Messiah, Whom You have sent.”

B. Main Argument/Point 1: Knowledge Transforms Character and Is Indispensable to Salvation.
Foundational Assertion(s) Addressed: A saving relationship requires this knowledge.
Author's Explanation/Elaboration: Salvation demands restoration of God’s image, accomplished only through knowing Him.
Key Authorial Statement: “The knowledge of God is life eternal, and life eternal is the knowledge of God.”

Supporting Other Texts:

Reference: Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, p. 289
Quoted Text: “The knowledge of God as revealed in Christ is the knowledge that all who are saved must have. It is the knowledge that works transformation of character. This knowledge, received, will recreate the soul in the image of God. It will impart to the whole being a spiritual power that is divine.”
Author's Use/Relevance: Demonstrates that such knowledge is essential and inherently transformative.

C. Main Argument/Point 2: Grace and Peace Are Channelled Through Knowledge of God.
Foundational Assertion(s) Addressed: Divine power comes via knowledge.
Author's Explanation/Elaboration: 2 Peter 1:2-4 shows grace and peace “multiplied” through the knowledge of God; Romans texts define grace and peace experientially.
Key Authorial Statement: “Grace and peace do not just happen; they flow through the knowledge of God.”

Supporting Scripture:

Reference: 2 Peter 1:2-4
Author's Use/Interpretation: Links all gifts “pertaining to life and godliness” to knowledge.
Quoted Text: “Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, As His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue, By which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.”

Reference: Romans 8:7
Author's Use/Interpretation: Defines the carnal mind as enmity.
Quoted Text: “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”

Reference: Romans 5:1
Author's Use/Interpretation: Shows justification produces peace with God.
Quoted Text: “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”

Supporting Other Texts:

Reference: The Great Controversy, p. 394
Quoted Text: “…the regenerating, enlightening power of the Holy Spirit.”
Author's Use/Relevance: Defines grace as active, transforming power rather than mere attitude.

D. Main Argument/Point 3: Rejecting Knowledge of God Produces Moral Degeneracy.
Foundational Assertion(s) Addressed: Cause-and-effect link between ignorance of God and sin.
Author's Explanation/Elaboration: Romans 1 documents humanity’s descent when knowledge of God is suppressed.
Key Authorial Statement: “The level of morality is directly determined by the knowledge of God’s character.”

Supporting Scripture:

Reference: Romans 1:18-32
Author's Use/Interpretation: Provides a case study of moral decline following rejection of divine revelation.
Quoted Text (abridged): “For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men… Because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful… Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools… And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting…” (full passage cited in text)

E. Main Argument/Point 4: Meagre or False Concepts Cripple Spiritual Experience and Must Be Corrected.
Foundational Assertion(s) Addressed: Even believers stagnate when their concept of God is dim or distorted.
Author's Explanation/Elaboration: Shallow views hinder progress; Christ’s ministry—and the end-time message—corrects Satan’s misrepresentations.
Key Authorial Statement: “Old concepts will be challenged; many things about God will be exactly opposite from what has been believed.”

Supporting Other Texts:

Reference: Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 743
Quoted Text: “By sin the image of God in man has been marred and well-nigh obliterated… And how can we come into harmony with God, how shall we receive His likeness, unless we obtain a knowledge of Him? It is this knowledge that Christ came into the world to reveal unto us.”
Author's Use/Relevance: Shows deeper knowledge is required for harmony and restoration.

Reference: Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 744
Quoted Text: “Brethren and sisters, it is by beholding that we become changed. By dwelling upon the love of God and our Saviour, by contemplating the perfection of the divine character and claiming the righteousness of Christ as ours by faith, we are to be transformed into the same image.”
Author's Use/Relevance: Explains the mechanism of transformation—beholding God’s character.

Reference: Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 177
Quoted Text: “He presented to men that which was exactly contrary to the representations of the enemy in regard to the character of God.”
Author's Use/Relevance: Sets Christ’s example for correcting false views of God.

III. KEY TERMINOLOGY / CONCEPTS INTRODUCED OR DEFINED:
Knowledge of God: Accurate, relational comprehension of God’s character as revealed in Christ; identical with eternal life.

Grace of God: “The regenerating, enlightening power of the Holy Spirit” (GC 394).

Peace with God: The indwelling presence of God that replaces the enmity of the carnal mind (Rom 8:7 → 5:1).

Meagre / False Views of God: Distorted concepts that stifle spiritual growth and foster sin.

IV. CHAPTER CONCLUSION / SYNTHESIS:
The chapter concludes that every dimension of Christian life—power, peace, character, destiny—rises or falls with one’s grasp of God’s true character. Hence the supreme pursuit of believers must be the diligent, prayerful contemplation of God as revealed in Jesus, for “to know God is life eternal, and life eternal is to know God.”
